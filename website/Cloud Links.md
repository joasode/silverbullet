You can access the “markdown web” through SilverBullet directly. The idea of the the markdown web (we really need a better name) is simple: the Internet is a messy place — tracking everywhere, tons of banners and other stuff — let’s bring it back to the basics. How about Markdown?

SilverBullet supports navigating this markdown web via cloud links, they’re simply wiki links that start with “💭 “. For instance: [[💭 silverbullet.md/SilverBullet]]. When you click one of these links, SilverBullet will simply pull in its content and present it to you in read-only mode (and do some clever internal link rewriting). What it does is simply fetch the link via HTTPs and postfix the url with `.md`, so [[💭 silverbullet.md/SilverBullet]] will fetch [this page](https://silverbullet.md/Silver%20Bullet.md). You can access all of the SilverBullet website this way, for instance here’s the [[💭 silverbullet.md/CHANGELOG]].

To publish your own content this way, simply create an `index.md` on your host (this will be fetched as the main page), and publish all the rest of your content as `.md` files alongside it. That’s all there’s to it.
