Markdown is a plain text formatting system [originally developed by John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). It has since been standardized into [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/), which is what SilverBullet uses (with some extensions).

If youâ€™re not yet familiar with Markdown [here is a good guide to get you started](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

We mentioned markdown _extensions_, here are the ones currently supported:

* [[Frontmatter]]
* Double-bracketed wiki links: `[[link to page]]`, optionally with aliases `[[link to page|alias]]`.
* Hashtags, e.g. `#mytag`.
* Command link syntax: `{[Stats: Show]}` rendered into a clickable button {[Stats: Show]}.
* [[Markdown/Code Widgets]]
* [Tables](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables)
* [Fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks)
* [Task lists](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#task-lists)
* [Highlight](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#highlight)
* [Automatic URL linking](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#automatic-url-linking)
* Custom markdown extensions provided by plugs
