As part of SilverBulletâ€™s [[Vim]] support, the [[VIMRC]] page allows you to run a set of _ex_ commands on boot. To use this functionality, create a page in your space named [[VIMRC]] and put a fenced code block (as demonstrated below) with one ex command per line, for example:

```
imap jj <Esc>
```

To manually reload your [[VIMRC]] you can use the {[Editor: Vim: Load VIMRC]} command.
