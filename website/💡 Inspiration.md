Inspiration for SilverBullet comes primarily from
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and its vast plug-in ecosystem (the
work-in-progress plugs around querying and tasks are inspired by Obsidianâ€™s tasks and dataview plugins), but also [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) was an inspiration.

The way plugs are implemented is a further iteration on how this was done in a previous project of mine (now defunct) called [Zed](https://github.com/zedapp/zed) as well as [Matterless](https://github.com/zefhemel/matterless).
